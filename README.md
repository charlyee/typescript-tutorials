# TypeScript Tutorials

## 1: First Steps - Developer Environment

### Suggested IDE:
Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/

This is my personal recommendation for an IDE to use, and that I have used it extensively with TypeScript to great success and that the IDE really helps TypeScript work well and that the IDE really keeps you on track at all stages of development.

### Suggested Extensions (for Visual Studio Code):

1: ESLint

2: Material Icon Theme

3: Path Intellisense

4: Prettier - Code Formatter

5: TSLint 

6: Live Reload

Extensions can be thought of as adding additional functionalities to the IDE, these can range from highlighting code a certain way, changing the colors that you see on the screen, giving you better more concise error messages, better autocomplete and much much more. 

But the jist of it is that you should ultimately think about them as being like adding additional powers to your integrated developer environment.


### Auto Format

I STRONGLY advise students to use this and to use this very frequently. Autoformatting often will help your code be much much more easily readable and manageable. Especially now we have introduced you to more advanced syntax such as "fat arrow functions" and classes.

Where is it Located?

By default they should be: alt, shift, f.

- Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts 

- Then search for ‘format document’

- This will bring up your particular keybinds for autoformatting. 

By default they should be: alt, shift, f.

## 2: How To Run WITH HTML INTEGRATION (Hello Project Work!!!! :) )

####PART 1: 

1: Create an `index.html` file (as you are used to).

2: File structure (as you are used to). How have you set up your folders and files in the past for projects? It does not change much here. `styles`, `html` etc.

3: Typescript files have the .ts file extension at the end. Similar to how javascript had .js and html files have .html file extensions.

Create a TypeScript file with the name like `main.ts`
